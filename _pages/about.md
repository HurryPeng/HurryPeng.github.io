I am Haoran Peng, a Ph.D. student at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, co-advised by Professors **[Michael Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/)**, **[Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/)** and **[Gilbert Bernstein](http://www.gilbertbernstein.com/)**. I did my undergrad at University of Science and Technology of China, where I gained my first experiences about compilers with Professor **[Yu Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yuzhang/)**. 

We live by languages, and so do machines. It is through programming languages that we talk to machines. I am enthusiastic about researches in **Programming Languages and Software Engineering** that maximize humans' expressiveness of their intelligence by offloading mechanical work to **Systems**. 

I am currently focused on **automated C to Rust translation**. I built **[Hayroll](https://github.com/UW-HARVEST/Hayroll)**, a tool that translates C macros and conditional compilation to Rust using static program analysis. I am exploring ways to incorporate into LLM-based translators human-like workflows, aiming to achieve better interpretability, better human control, and better translation quality.
